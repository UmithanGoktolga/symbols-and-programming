;; Define a procedure that takes three numbers and gives back the second largest of them. 
;;

;; 
;; Define a procedure that halves a given number until the result becomes less than 1 -- solve the problem by making your procedure call itself.
;;

(defun halver (n)

;; 
;; Rewrite (AND X Y Z W) by using COND (Touretzky 1990).
;;

;; 
;; Write COND statements equivalent to:

;; Question
;; 
;; The following definition is meant to mimic the behavior of IF using
;; AND and OR.
;; 
;; (defun custom-if (test succ fail) ; wrong!
;;      (or (and test succ) fail))
;; 
;; But it is unsatisfactory in one case, what is it?  Define a better procedure
;; which avoids this failure (Touretzky 1990).
;; 

; Take for instance (custom-if 3 (< 5 4) 8), this incorrectly would return 8 instead of NIL. 
; Here is a correct version

(defun custom-if (test succ fail)
  (or (and test succ) (and (not test) fail)))
